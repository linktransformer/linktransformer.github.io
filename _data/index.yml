        title: Easy Record Linkage with Deep Learning Models
        description: |
          With the help of state-of-the-art deep learning models, LinkTransformer brings the advantages of artificial intelligence to standard data frame manipulation tasks like deduplication, clustering, and merges.
          Using most deep-learning libraries and pipelines for these tasks is out of reach for the average data analyst. LinkTransformer makes using these models in a standard data-wrangling workflow easy with just a few lines of code.
          Training your own models is also as easy as one line of code with most of the heavy lifting done behind the scenes. The API is designed to be as simple as possible and very familiar to practitioners coming from other environments like R and Stata.

        title: Easy Text Classification with Deep Learning Models
        description: |
          LinkTransformer allows a simple way to access the power of Transformer language models in a simple API to classify rows of a dataframe in one line of code!
          It supports both [OpenAI](https://chat.openai.com/) and [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) models for the task.
          We recommend binary classification for beginners, but also support multi-class classification and also support weighted training loss to allow for unbalanced training classes.
          All you need is a data frame of text you want to classify (row-by-row) to use a pretrained model for classification (like ChatGPT) or a datframe of Text and Class "labels" to train your own models within minutes - that too within a colab session!

        title: All models on Hugging Face and Open AI embeddings are supported
        description: |
          LinkTransformer supports all models on the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=sentence-similarity&sort=trending) (we recommend those trained for sentence similarity tasks) and [OpenAI Embedding models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings). To accommodate heterogeneous use cases, LinkTransformer has also trained our own collection of open-source language models on different datasets for record linkage. A guide to selecting models is included in our [Introductory Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SAvQdgYiX2CinoTC8Y5qtKScNwx3DYXf). Currently, there are over 20 models trained on diverse datasets which can be downloaded from Hugging Face and are discoverable at [this link](https://huggingface.co/models?other=linktransformer).

    #     title: Easy Layout Data Manipulation and Processing
    #     description: |
    #       LinkTransformer supports different levels of abstraction of layout data, and provides three classes of representation for layout data, namely, `Coordinates`, `TextBlock`, and `Layout`. The same operations and transformations are supported inter and intra these classes to maximize the efficiency when processing the layout data.

    #     description: | 
    #       LinkTransformer visualizes the layout data using a simple syntax: `lp.draw_box` or `lp.draw_text`. It provides two modes for displaying the layout data: Mode I directly overlays the layout region bounding boxes and categories over the original image. Mode II recreates the original document via drawing the OCR’d texts at their corresponding positions on the image canvas.

    #     description: | 
    #       LinkTransformer supports loading and exporting layout data to different formats, including general formats like `csv`, `json`, or domain-specific formats like `PAGE`, `COCO`, or `METS/ALTO` format (Full support for them will be released soon). It provides the flexibility for integrating LinkTransformer with other document image analysis pipelines, and makes it easy to share your outputs with the community.

      #   description: |
      #     No labeled training data available? Don't worry! LinkTransformer also incorporates a data annotation toolkit that enables creating the training dataset much more efficiently. 
      #     Shown in the illustration below, the tool loads layout predictions from pre-trained models (a), and users only need to select and check a small percentage of model predictions to correct or relabel (b). False-Negative Highlighter (c) helps recognize mis-identified objects from the model predictions. After these steps, the full image annotation is created with less effort.

        title: Sharing Trained models on the HuggingFace Hub
        description: |
          LinkTransformer aims to create a community for deep record linkage, as deep learning has currently made few inroads into record linkage. Making open-source, pre-trained models available is particularly important for democratizing the benefits of deep learning. LinkTransformer is well-integrated with the hugging face hub, and all models can be uploaded/downloaded with a single line of code. Our own models are shared on the hub, and we encourage the community to share their models as well. If you use the library to upload LinkTransformer models, they automatically get a “tag” on Hugging Face and become discoverable on this [link](https://huggingface.co/models?other=linktransformer). By streamlining the distribution of record linkage models, as well as promoting the reusability of these deep learning-based pipelines, Linktransformer can transform how social scientists build their record linkage workflows.
