        title: Easy Record Linkage with Deep Learning Models
        description: |
          With the help of state-of-the-art deep learning models, LinkTransformer brings the advantages of artificial intelligence to standard dataframe manipulation tasks like deduplication, clustering, and merges.
          Using most deep-learning libraries and pipelines for these tasks is out of reach for the average data analyst. LinkTransformer makes using these models in a standard daata wrangling workflow easy with just a few lines of code.
          Training your own models is also as easy as one line of code with most of the heavy lifting done behind the scenes. The API is designed to be as simple as possible and very familiar to practitioners coming from other environments like R and Stata.

        description: |
          To accommodate heterogenous document layout structures, LinkTransformer a collection of DL models trained on different datasets. Currently, there are over 10 models trained on diverse datasets which can be downloaded from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/dell-research-harvard)

    #     title: Easy Layout Data Manipulation and Processing
    #     description: |
    #       LinkTransformer supports different levels of abstraction of layout data, and provides three classes of representation for layout data, namely, `Coordinates`, `TextBlock`, and `Layout`. The same operations and transformations are supported inter and intra these classes to maximize the efficiency when processing the layout data.

    #     title: Highly Customizable Layout Data Visualization 
    #     description: | 
    #       LinkTransformer visualizes the layout data using a simple syntax: `lp.draw_box` or `lp.draw_text`. It provides two modes for displaying the layout data: Mode I directly overlays the layout region bounding boxes and categories over the original image. Mode II recreates the original document via drawing the OCR’d texts at their corresponding positions on the image canvas.

    #   - name: Export and Storage
    #     title: Export Layout Data in Your Favorite Format
    #     description: | 
    #       LinkTransformer supports loading and exporting layout data to different formats, including general formats like `csv`, `json`, or domain-specific formats like `PAGE`, `COCO`, or `METS/ALTO` format (Full support for them will be released soon). It provides the flexibility for integrating LinkTransformer with other document image analysis pipelines, and makes it easy to share your outputs with the community.

          LinkTransformer also comes with full support for customized record linkage model training on your own dataset. This enables you to achieve optimal prediction accuracy on your own dataset and can simplify your pipeline. 
          You can train your own or fine-tune any pretrained model from Hugging Face! Learn more details at our [repo](https://github.com/dell-research-harvard/linktransformer).

      #   description: |
      #     No labeled training data available? Don't worry! LinkTransformer also incorporates a data annotation toolkit that enables creating the training dataset much more efficiently. 
      #     Shown in the illustration below, the tool loads layout predictions from pre-trained models (a), and users only need to select and check a small percentage of model predictions to correct or relabel (b). False-Negative Highlighter (c) helps recognize mis-identified objects from the model predictions. After these steps, the full image annotation is created with less effort.

        title: Sharing Trained models on the HuggingFace Hub
        description: |
          LinkTransformer also aims to create a community platform for deep record linkage. Since Deep Learning has barely made any inroads into Record Linkage/Entity matching, trained models would benefit the community - especially those who can't train models themselves. 
          Since LinkTransformers is well-integrated with the HuggingFace hub, all models can be uploaded/downloaded with a single line of code. By streamlining the distribution of record linkage models, as well as promoting the reusability of these deep learning-based pipelines, Linktrasnformer can completely transform the record-linkage workflow and pipelines broadly. 
          Our own models are shared on the hub, and we welcome the community to share their own models as well.
